# Survey-Form
Building a Survey Form using HTML and CSS
We will create a survey form using HTML and CSS. The form will include various questions for users to answer. We will use HTML to design the basic layout of the form, and CSS to enhance the design with elements such as text decoration, text color, background color, text alignment, margin, padding, and more.
**Approach**
**1.** The <form> element is used to create an HTML form for user input.
**2.** Inside the form element, provide different options to the user like name, email, age, etc. In HTML, we have different input elements for different tasks. So, we are providing respective input types according to the question (email for taking email input, text-area for taking a large message, name for taking name input, etc.).
**3.** We have also used the radio-button (let a user selection of the provided choices.), check-button (let a user select zero or more options of the provided choices), and submit-button (the button for submitting the form data to a form-handler).
